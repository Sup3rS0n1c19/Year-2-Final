This is my final project for my T-Level course. It includes a front-end and back-end solution with a database. It is mainly developed in C# but the database is in SQL.

When installing the .zip file, there is something you should be aware of:
Make sure the file is unblocked. This will ensure that the application encounters no problems regarding the "mark of the web"

After you've successfully loaded up the solution you should:
Create a database called Customer.mdf in your local directory.
Press "Ctrl + H" which is the quick bind for the action "Find and Replace"

This is a short video on how the application works:
